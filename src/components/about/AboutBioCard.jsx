      <p>
        Iâ€™m a passionate software engineer with a strong foundation in full-stack development, system design, and backend architecture. My journey began in college, where I built projects that solved real-world problems using technologies like <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>React</strong>, and <strong>Spring Boot</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond coding, I actively contribute to open-source communities and enjoy exploring scalable backend systems, clean architecture, and DevOps workflows. My dedication to <strong>problem solving</strong> and <strong>clean code</strong> drives me to continuously learn and innovate.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm currently looking for opportunities to collaborate on impactful projects and grow as a developer within dynamic engineering teams.
